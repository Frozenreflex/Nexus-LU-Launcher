# Nexus Lego Universe Launcher
Nexus Lego Universe Launcher is a custom, cross-platform
user interface for installing and launching Lego Universe
for community-run Lego Universe servers.
![Launcher example](images/launcher.png)

## Goals
The goals of the launcher is the following:
* Allow for launching the client on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
* Use a user interface similar to the original Lego Universe launcher.
* Automate the process of downloading the client, installing patches,
  and launching Lego Universe.
* Be able to select from a list of servers to connect to.
* Enable the installation of optional patches.
* Automate the process of basic setup for servers.
  * Note: This will be implemented later for the user interface.
    This functionally is present for the CLI build, but only supports
    Uchu right now, and still requires manually setting up databases.

## Non-Goals
The following aren't current goals of the launcher, but could
be made at some point:
* Provide a method to change the locale.
  * This feature could be worked on but requires work on the client to enable
    localization. The primary blocker for this is translations for the client.
* Automate installing WINE for non-Windows installs.
* Enable management of hosted servers, such as player permissions.
* Enable advanced, configurable patches, such as modifying the client database.

# Building
Nexus Lego Universe Launcher requires .NET 5.0 to be installed
since it allows packaging as single files without the requirement of
decompressing files. After cloning the repository **with the submodules**,
building can be done with the `dotnet build`:
```bash
dotnet build
```
or `dotnet publish` command:
```bash
dotnet publish
```

For creating the distributables in, there is a Python script that builds the
CLI and GUI projects for win-x64, osx-x64, and linux-x64:
```bash
python publish.py
cd bin/ # The ZIP files of the distributables will be in bin/ of the repository.
```

# Additions
## Patches
Patches can be added and will be approved in pull requests if there
is a proper justification to have them. They can including finishing incomplete
features on the client, like guilds, or components that allow the client
to work, like alternative communication mods.

## Servers (Coming Soon)
Servers *will* rely mostly on the community to manage due to the implementation
requirements. It *will be* recommended to focus on servers that have a high
level of functionality, like Uchu and Operation Crux. At this point, pull
requests may not be accepted as the implementation is incomplete and may
change.
